It is my pleasure to express my gratitude to all the people who supported me in the successful completion of this Master’s Thesis. \\

\noindent
First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Christian Rupprecht for his guidance throughout this work. He was always available to provide valuable inputs and support without which this work would not have been possible. \\

\noindent
Secondly, I would like to thank Dr. Federico Tombari for his kind supervision and guidance to steer the work in the right direction. \\

\noindent
I am also grateful to Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab for allowing me to undertake this
Master’s Thesis under the supervision of his chair. \\

\noindent
Finally, I must express my gratitude to my family for their continuous moral and
financial support throughout the duration of my studies.
